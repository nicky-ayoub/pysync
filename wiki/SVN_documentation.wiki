SVN is a centralized VCS, meaning that only one master copy of the software is used.

<ul>
  <li> Subversion itself does not distinguish between a tag, a branch, and a directory 
  </li>
  <li> Natively client/server, layered library design.
  </li>
  <li> The Subversion file system can be described as a three dimensional filesystem. Since most representations of a directory tree (e.g., tree view) are two dimensional, the added dimension is that of revisions. Each revision in a Subversion file system has its own root, which is used to access contents at that revision. Files are stored as links to the most recent change; thus a Subversion repository is quite compact.
  </li>
  <li> The <i>svn:externals</i> property is that once it is set on a versioned directory, everyone who checks out a working copy with that directory also gets the benefit of the externals definition.
  </li>
  <li> Subversion provides interfaces for adding, modifying, and removing versioned metadata on each of your versioned directories and files. 
  </li>
</ul>
