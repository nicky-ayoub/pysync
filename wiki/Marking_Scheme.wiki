Side note - here is something Greg posted on pysync discuss:
_If you folks want your marking scheme to say "five iterations, each about
two weeks long, with the goal for each set at the end of the previous one,
and each one worth 15% of the course grade" (with the remaining 25% for
the final deliverable, documentation, professionalism, etc.), I'm happy
with that._
