= Introduction =

Perforce is a centralized version control system. Of particular note:
 * The centralized server keeps track of client workspaces and even which files are open in the workspaces
 * Branches are directories but p4 keeps track of the origins of files
 * A depot is just a container for a numbered series of changesets. 
 * A revision of a file is uniquely identified by a domain, depot, path and any of {changeset id, date, file revision #}
