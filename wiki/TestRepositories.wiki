#summary Some repository designs to test against
#labels Phase-Design

= Introduction =

We we want some common version control workflows and implement them in each supported version control system for testing.

We'll also need a couple repositories for system-specific tests.

= Details =

=== Test 1 ===
  # Empty Repository
  # Set a property on root folder

=== Test 2 ===
  # Create empty file "README.txt"
  # Add "Hello, world" in UTF-8 to README.txt
  # Rename README.txt to README
  # Delete README

=== Test 3 ===
  # Create directory 'dir/' and put empty file 'file' in it

=== Test 4 ===
  # Add a valid .png file (with and without extension) and other difficult-to-recognize binary blob file in root folder

=== Test 5 === 
  # Create a file 'fruit.txt' with contents 
{{{
apple
banana
cherry
}}}
  # Create branch with contents
{{{
apple
banana
cherry
date
}}}
  # In trunk, modify to
{{{
apples
bananas
cherry
}}}
  # Merge branch into trunk

=== Test 6 ===
  # Create empty file 'file.txt'
  # Create branch with additional file 'new.txt'
  # In trunk, modify 'file.txt' to add text "All your rebase"
  # In branch, pull in the trunk change
  # In branch, modify 'file.txt' to append text "are belong to us"
  # Merge branch into trunk

== Subversion only ==

=== Test SVN1 ===
  # Repository with branches/, tags/, trunk/,

=== Test SVN2 ===
  # Repository without branches/, tags/, trunk/
